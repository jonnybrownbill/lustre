## Peter Hunter Rooboo, Bardi elder

They used to go to dry shelling over there. And the reefs used to get dry. They used to get on the reefs and start dry shelling, filling their bags. That’s *Jooloom*, that island. They’ve got pearlshell along there. For the reef, this one here and there’s *Bowooloon*, and there’s *Boolnginy* and *Imbalgoon* down the reef, with all *Bardi* names. They used to go up towards Strickland Bay way. And the Graveyard there’s Japanese graves and Asian people’s graves there, yeah, on that island. Very strong tide from there. A tide rip is you’ll see some coming through when the tide’s coming in and starts to make lots of whirlpool. Its really ripping through the rocks. Straight on up that point, from *Jooloom*, there’s a big drop there, a little bit of valley on the reef, and the divers couldn’t dive down there. They used to jump over to the other side, get dragged with the lugger. Some of them went down there. They were game. They got the bends.

## James Brown, Pearl farmer

Pearlshell beds are quite happy to grow in quite tight concentrations, and *Pinctada maxima* will do that again. So, most of the Eighty Mile Beach is generally fairly flat and the reef sections that are there are not too tall. There’s little crevices, but not much, and then there’re lots of moving sands, undulating sandy areas, and amongst that you get a range of habitat, but then these pearls or pearlshell oysters will grow in patches. The industry or the divers and the dive teams will call them different types of patches. You’ve got potato bottom, whip bottom, sponge bottom. These names describe the different types of habitat that the shell co exist with. Small sponges and ascidians growing on hard bottom, quite often with these tall hydrozoan whips, and then the *Pinctada maxima* will just be nestled in amongst all that.

## Roy Wiggan Bagayi, Bardi elder

Diving, its a paradise. I’ve never seen anything like it down the bottom of the sea. Where there’s hundred fathom, pearlshell, coral. Beautiful. It's paradise.
