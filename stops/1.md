## Jacky Dedelot, Button maker

(translation by Patrick Amadieu)

I worked with my father who opened a small family enterprise for the fabrication of the making of buttons, of pearl buttons, white and grey. Mother of pearl from Trochus.

The work was my universe. I used to play climbing on the shell mounds piles by the door of the workshop.

Mother of pearl, it is that there is little yellow, because of the crust of the nacre, it is always yellow.

I talked with the gentlemen who has worked with it and was interested in the Broome’s nacre, differentiated from Broome at this level, that is, there is much more white than yellow. It is formidable because you were straight in, and yellow buttons were worth nothing. The mother of pearl from Broome is indeed superb. It is a beautiful nacre. When it comes to the white nacre, Broome comes first. Broome is ahead of it all.

## George Major, Pearly King

I’m the Pearly King of Peckam, which is in South London. My title is a Pearly King. I inherited it from my mother’s side of the family. When you’re born into it, you’re proud of it, and that pride takes you to your death.

Pearly King and Queens, they started from the costermongers, which is what people know as market traders, in London. It was set in the early 1700’s that a Coster King was first elected into supporting the poor, sick and needy. The first one was Samuel King, and they just had a flash of pearl buttons, they were smoke pearl buttons then, and it sewn on the jacket, trousers and few on the hat. That was the Coster King.

Then, in 1850 we converted from the Coster King to the Pearly King, where you covered the whole suit with mother of pearl buttons. And they came from a shell which is from around the coast, the Australian coast and the Japanese coast. Pearl buttons, because when you’re walking down the road, especially as its getting a bit dark, they glitter and they’re shiny so that people can see you easily so you can raise bees and honey, which is money, to raise for charity. We’re all about helping the poor sick and needy and them shells help us do it.
